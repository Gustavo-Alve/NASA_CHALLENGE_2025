# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a project developed as part of the 2025 NASA International Space Apps Challenge. The challenge is a global hackathon held on October 4â€“5, 2025, where participants collaborate to create open-source solutions addressing Earth and space-related challenges using open data from NASA and its international space agency partners.

## About the Project

The NASA Space Apps Challenge invites scientists, engineers, coders, designers, storytellers, and space enthusiasts to innovate with NASA's open datasets. Projects typically focus on themes like Earth observation, space exploration, climate science, and more, fostering global collaboration to solve real-world problems.

This repo is maintained by Gustavo-Alve and represents a submission or prototype built during the event. (Specific project details, such as the targeted challenge or solution, will be updated here once implemented.)

## Technologies Used

- [List technologies here, e.g., Python, JavaScript, NASA APIs, etc.]
- Data sources: NASA Earthdata, open APIs from partner agencies.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gustavo-Alve/NASA_CHALLENGE_2025.git
   cd NASA_CHALLENGE_2025
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have Python/Node.js/etc. installed.
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or equivalent for your stack).

3. **Setup Environment**:
   - Obtain API keys for NASA data if required (visit [NASA Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/)).
   - Configure any environment variables in a `.env` file.

4. **Run the Project**:
   - For a web app: `npm start` or `python app.py`.
   - For data analysis: Execute Jupyter notebooks in `/notebooks/`.

## Usage

- Explore the code in `/src/` for the core implementation.
- Run tests with `pytest` or similar.
- View demos or outputs in `/docs/` or `/outputs/`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repo, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request. Focus on open-source best practices to align with the challenge's spirit.
